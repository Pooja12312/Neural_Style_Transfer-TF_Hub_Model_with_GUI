# Neural_Style_Transfer-TF_Hub_Model_with_GUI

## Overview

This project applies neural style transfer to images using a pre-trained model from TensorFlow Hub. Neural style transfer is a technique that blends the content of one image with the style of another, creating a new image that looks like the content image painted in the style of the style image.

## Features

- Use pre-trained models from TensorFlow Hub.
- Load content and style images from local storage or URLs.
- Generate stylized images.
- Save and display the results.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- TensorFlow Hub
- Matplotlib
- Pillow
- NumPy
